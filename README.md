[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

A React app with GraphQL client interfacing with [Cardano GraphQL](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql).

### Environment Variables
See [environment](source/environment.ts) for defaults.
- `CARDANO_ERA`
- `CARDANO_NETWORK`
- `GRAPHQL_API_PROTOCOL`
- `GRAPHQL_API_HOST`
- `GRAPHQL_API_PORT`
- `GRAPHQL_API_PATH`
- `REAL_TIME_FACTOR`
- `GA_TRACKING_ID`
- `DEBUG`

## Build
```console
yarn && yarn static:build
```
## Deploy
The static bundle can be deployed using a standard web server. A simple [Node.js program](deploy/index.js) 
is available for deploying the build to an AWS S3 bucket.

```console
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key node \
./deploy/example_deployment.js
```

## Development
The environment is configured to access a remote managed deployment of the API, 
however you can run a local stack using Docker and use a `.env` to work offline. 
See [.env.example](.env.example)

### `yarn dev`
- Starts the development version of the app by default at http://localhost:4000
- Generates graphql typings from the referenced schema in [`@cardano-graphql/client-ts`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql/tree/master/packages/client-ts) 
and documents within the codebase.
- Any changes to graphql documents will trigger the TypeScript generator.

###  Storybook

All visual components should be developed in Storybook first.

### `yarn storybook`

### Continuous Deployment
The `develop` and PR branches are deployed continuously for the purpose of testing and development:
